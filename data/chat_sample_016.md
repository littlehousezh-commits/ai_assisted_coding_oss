We are creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new save-selection feature. Guide me through this process by asking targeted questions one section at a time. Wait for my response before moving to the next section.

Start with these sections in order:

1. **Problem Statement & Vision**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who experiences this problem?
   - What's our vision for the solution?

2. **Target Users & Use Cases**
   - Who are our primary users?
   - What are their main goals?
   - What are the key user journeys?

3. **Core Features & Requirements**
   - What are the must-have features?
   - What are nice-to-have features?
   - Any technical constraints?

4. **Success Metrics & Goals**
   - How will we measure success?
   - What are our key performance indicators?
   - What's our timeline?

5. **Technical Considerations**
   - Any platform requirements?
   - Integration needs?
   - Scalability expectations?

Ask 2-3 focused questions for each section, then synthesise the information into a well-structured PRD format that will saved in the `docs/1_planning/` folder. Make the questions specific and actionable.

Let's start with the Problem Statement & Vision section.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Outlining initial approach**Kicking off the PRD by clarifying the problem space and vision. Here’s how we’ll tackle this first section:

- Understand the core pain point driving the need for a save-selection feature.
- Identify who feels that pain most acutely.
- Capture a concise vision for the solution we want to build.

Could you share:
1. What specific workflow or scenario is currently painful because we can’t save selections?
2. Which particular users (roles, skill levels, contexts) are most affected by this gap?
3. If we nailed this feature, what does the ideal future state look and feel like for those users?

---

Currently, "save canvas" saves the entire canvas (as b&w, minus background). While a screen-sized canvas makes the most use of browser real estate, it results in arbitrarily-sized images. These sizes are not suited for social media (or other publication) without editing.

"Save-selection" means the user should be able to SELECT a PORTION of the canvas to save. This could be a completely free-form (but grid-aligned) rectangle, but we could also constrain to preset ratios - 1:1, 4:5, etc. (complete list TBD).

This would allow users to easily output visual text that is social-media ready.

I don't have a clear vision for the interface. Possibly, the existing shortcut key would continue to the existing save feature. But the introduction of a modifier key (command, option, shift or combination) plus existing shortcut key would enable a "save-selection interface." We could start with a 1:1 rectangle overlay on-canvas - the selection are is draggable by click+drag anywhere on the canvas (the mouse does NOT need to be within the rectangle to drag). The area inside the selection looks like normal text-canvas (background etc). The area OUTSIDE the selection is ... different in some way. lighter, darker, grayscale - I'm not completely sure. The selection area is resizeable by click+drag on edges or corners. The selection area will resize according to selected ratio (default 1:1, set in code). The ratios are selected from a UI overlay on-screen. This could be canvas-rendered or HTML. The latter would be easier to render, but might make canvas-vs-html interaction more difficult.

For MVP/POC of this feature, we can skip the ratio UI and default to a 1:1 ratio.

Not only will this feature allow the saving of media-friendly texts, it will show us some pain points in the system as we open up the UI and add future features. For example, the current canvas architecture does not have distinct layers, and relies on re-rendering the text when saving. Adding a layer feature is beyond the scope of save-selection, but may highlight other pain points or workarounds. Maybe we don't need layers.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing focused follow-up questions**Capturing the pain points you shared and double-checking a few specifics so we can lock the Problem Statement & Vision:

- Pin down the exact publishing or sharing contexts where the current full-canvas export forces extra editing—are there particular platforms (Instagram, Tumblr, print) or resolution guidelines we should explicitly design around?
- You mentioned the selection should probably stay grid-aligned; can we assume that even a “free-form” rectangle must snap to the text grid, or do you see value in letting users break that rule for edge cases?
- Beyond saving social-ready crops, is there a larger creative or workflow goal this feature should fulfill (e.g., making rapid series of themed exports, prepping assets for other tools, enabling collaborative reviews)?

---

_**User**_

The canvas-size is completely arbitrary, dependent even on that monitor the browser is on maximised, or size of the browser. The resulting output is irregular across sessions, leading to a lack of consistency in documented output. Resolution of the output is not the primary concern here, but I would like it as high as possible.

Snap to the text grid. I do not see any value is breaking that rule for now.

No larger workflow goal atm.

A planned feature is animated, moving blocks. Thus we would save a series of frames to assemble into an animation in other software. Saving these in a standard ratio would be good.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing problem statement and vision synthesis**Locking in the Problem Statement & Vision now; plan is to capture the summary for this section and follow with the next set of discovery questions.

## Problem Statement & Vision
- **Problem**: Current “save canvas” exports mirror whatever arbitrary browser window size the artist is using, so outputs vary wildly between sessions. This inconsistency makes social-ready documentation—and soon, animation frame capture—painful because every export needs manual resizing or cropping afterward. High resolution is still desired, but consistent aspect ratios are the priority.
- **Who Feels It**: Dragline artists and poets working on text-grid compositions, especially those preparing pieces for publication or future animation workflows.
- **Vision**: Introduce a grid-snapped selection overlay (defaulting to a 1:1 crop) that can be dragged anywhere on the canvas and resized within preset ratios, pairing the existing save shortcut with a modifier to enter selection mode. Outside the selection, the canvas is visually deemphasized, delivering a focused, repeatable export that stays ready for social channels and animation sequences.

## Target Users & Use Cases – Questions
1. Who do you imagine relying on save-selection most often—experimenting artists, workshop participants, social-media curators, or another group?
2. What’s the top scenario where they need to save a selection (e.g., sharing a single poetic block on Instagram, exporting a set of frames for animation assembly, documenting iterations for critique)?
3. Could you walk me through one end-to-end journey—from seeing the composition on screen to having the cropped asset ready for its destination—so we can anchor the user flow?

---

_**User**_

1. experimenting artists, workshop participants. TBH, probably just me.

2. top scenario is sharing a block of text on Instagram or blogs (where block is the interleaved output rendered on canvas, not the "text blocks" that are used as source).

3. The user has found a pleasing interleave of text and wants to document it. They choose selection save. The predefined selection box appears. The user drags and resizes the selection to capture and exclude as desired. The final save is initiated with the standard save shortcut. The selection box disappears and the interaction is complete.

3a. The user has re-arranged some, but not all. parts of the canvas and wants to document **the same area as before**. They choose selection save. The selection box appears in the same size and postion is was previously used. The user can still drag and resize the selection to capture and exclude as desired. The final save is initiated with the standard save shortcut. The selection box disappears and the interaction is complete.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing Target section summary and questions**Appreciate the clarity—I'll capture the Target Users & Use Cases and then move us into defining the features.

**Plan**
- Summarize the Target Users & Use Cases section based on your input.
- Pose 2–3 focused questions for Core Features & Requirements.

## Target Users & Use Cases
- **Primary users**: Experimenting artists and workshop participants (currently centered on your own creative workflow) who rely on Dragline’s generative text compositions.
- **Primary scenarios**: Exporting a square or blog-friendly crop of an interleaved text composition (treated as a single visual block) for Instagram or blogging platforms.
- **Key journeys**:
  - *Fresh capture*: Artist discovers a pleasing arrangement, invokes selection save, adjusts the default 1:1 crop to include/exclude content, triggers the standard save shortcut, and completes the action as the overlay disappears.
  - *Repeat capture*: Artist revisits a previously saved area after minor canvas adjustments; selecting the save tool restores the last-used selection bounds, allowing quick tweaks before saving again.

## Core Features & Requirements – Questions
1. What behaviors must the selection overlay support for day-one (e.g., keyboard shortcut to enter mode, drag anywhere to move, resize handles, snapping feedback)?
2. Are there any “nice to have” enhancements you’d love if time permits (like ratio presets beyond 1:1, visual styling outside the crop, remembering multiple selections)?
3. Do you have any known technical constraints we should respect—performance ceilings, dependencies on existing save code, or architectural decisions we need to align with?

---

_**User**_

1. keyboard shortcut to ender, drag anywhere, resize handles, visual styling outside the selection.

2. snapping feedback is a nice-to-have, or day 2 feature.  ratio presets beyond 1:1 can be delayed if MVP inplementation is not smooth. Remembering multiple selection can wait, but it would be top of the priority list for day 2.

3. No known constraints. Existing save code may need to be refactored.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Summarizing features and planning questions**

I’m putting together a clear summary of the core features and requirements, focusing on essentials like keyboard shortcuts, drag-to-move, resize handles, and visual styling, while noting nice-to-haves like snapping and presets. Then, I’ll create thoughtful questions about success metrics and goals to clarify what counts as a win for the user.Capturing the feature set now so we can move on to defining success.

**Plan**
- Summarize the Core Features & Requirements from your notes.
- Ask focused questions for Success Metrics & Goals.

## Core Features & Requirements
- **Must-haves**: Keyboard shortcut to enter selection mode, draggable selection area (click-and-drag anywhere), resize handles, and a clear visual treatment outside the active crop.
- **Nice-to-haves**: Grid-alignment feedback (snapping cues), additional aspect-ratio presets beyond 1:1 once the MVP feels solid, and eventually the ability to remember multiple selections (priority for a follow-up release).
- **Constraints / Tech notes**: No blocking technical limits identified, though the current save pipeline will likely need some refactoring to support the new workflow cleanly.

## Success Metrics & Goals – Questions
1. What signals will tell us the feature is working—frequency of save-selection usage, reduction in post-export editing, or something else?
2. Which KPIs or qualitative feedback should we track during rollout (e.g., number of consistent aspect-ratio exports, creator satisfaction from playtests)?
3. Do you have a timeline or milestone in mind for releasing the MVP and any follow-up improvements?

---

_**User**_

1. There are no quantitative metrics for success. The signal will be I will manually test the feature and report success.

2. see 1.

3. Today, tomorrow..

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing technical considerations section**Noted on success measurement—manual validation is the key signal. I’ll record that and keep the timeline tight.

**Plan**
- Summarize the Success Metrics & Goals section.
- Ask targeted questions for Technical Considerations.

## Success Metrics & Goals
- **Measurement**: Manual testing confirmation—you’ll personally validate the feature meets the workflow needs.
- **KPIs/Signals**: None formal; qualitative confirmation via hands-on use.
- **Timeline**: ASAP—ideally today or tomorrow for the MVP.

## Technical Considerations – Questions
1. Which platforms/browsers must the save-selection feature support out of the gate (desktop only, macOS-specific, Chrome/Firefox minimum)?
2. Do we need to integrate with any existing storage, export, or Tumblr workflows beyond the current save pipeline?
3. Should we plan for any performance or scalability considerations—e.g., handling very large canvases, future animation frame batching, or multiple selections stored across sessions?

---

_**User**_

Chrome/Firefox. No. No.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing technical considerations summary and PRD plan**Thanks for the quick answers—here’s what comes next:

1. Capture the Technical Considerations from your notes.
2. Assemble everything into a structured PRD and drop it into ``.

## Technical Considerations
- **Platforms/Browsers**: Must work in Chrome and Firefox on desktop.
- **Integrations**: No new connections beyond the existing save pipeline.
- **Scalability/Performance**: No immediate concerns flagged; baseline implementation can assume single-selection persistence only.

I’ll now pull all the sections together into the PRD document.

_**User**_

Okay. Where is the PRD?

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing product requirements document**

I'm organizing the plan for a PRD file named save-selection-prd.md under docs/1_planning with clear sections like problem statement, users, features, metrics, and technical details. I’ll ensure the markdown structure is well laid out before using the create_file tool to make the document and then report its location.**Notifying about documentation update**PRD’s ready—pulled everything together and saved it to `save-selection-prd.md`. Let me know if you’d like tweaks or extra sections.

Is there a VS Code keybaord-shortvut feature that would allow me to move to different open editors/windows without cycling through all of them? My use case is wanting to switch to specific named projects, but when I have 8+ open I often have to cycle through many of them to get the one I want. I'm thinking of something similar to Chrome's SHIFT-CMD-A for search tabs that allowd me to find a tab by typing part of the URL or title.

---

_**Assistant**_

**Preparing answer and suggestions**I’ve got you—there’s a slick built-in way to jump straight to any open editor by name.

## Quick way to jump to a specific file/tab
- Hit **⌘P** (aka Quick Open).
- Start typing the filename, path fragment, or even a folder name.
- Press **Return** once the match you want is highlighted to switch right to it.

This works beautifully even with lots of files open, and it avoids cycling entirely. Quick Open also keeps a recency bias, so your frequent targets pop up fast.

## Handy related shortcuts
- **⌘B** toggles the explorer if you want to click the file after all.
- **⌃Tab** cycles through recently used editors in order—still a cycle, but smarter than left/right arrow keys.
- If you like the idea of a tab search dialog (Chrome-style), assign a keybinding to the “View: Show All Editors By Most Recently Used” command (`workbench.action.showAllEditorsByMostRecentlyUsed`). It opens a searchable list similar to what you described.

Let me know if you want a custom keybinding snippet or if you’re curious about extensions that go even further.

_**User**_

None of that solved my problem as they all seemed geared towards opening files or folders within the current project, and I am interested in jumping to another open project. However, following some of your suggestions I looked at similar menu items and found that CTRL-R gives me "open recent" that lists entire projects, and that let's me do what I want. What terminology or descriptions should I have used to get this outcome from my original prompt?

---

_**Assistant**_

**Clarifying workspace window switching terminology**Nice work tracking that down! To line up the right suggestions next time, you could frame the request like:

- “How do I **switch between open windows/workspaces** in VS Code without cycling through them all?”
- “Is there a **workspace switcher** or **Open Recent shortcut** so I can jump straight to another project window?”
- “Looking for a keyboard shortcut to **search across open VS Code windows** (not files) by name.”

Those keywords—*workspace*, *window*, *Open Recent*, *workbench.action.openRecent*—point directly at the **⌃R** quick picker you found, since VS Code treats each project as its own window/workspace rather than just another tab.

---

_**User**_

Is there another workspace switcher command in VS Code? Use context7 if you need to

---

_**Assistant**_

**Exploring commands in VS Code docs****Fetching documentation****Exploring additional workspace switcher commands****Summarizing window switch commands**Dialing in more workspace switcher options so you’ve got choices beyond ⌃R.

**Plan**
- Highlight built-in commands that open a searchable picker of workspaces/windows.
- Mention how to bind them if they’re not already on a convenient key.
- Include a couple of OS-level alternates for completeness.

## Workspace switcher commands in VS Code

- **Quick Switch Window**  
  Command: `Workspaces: Quick Switch Window` (`workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow`).  
  Default keybinding on macOS is **⌃R**—the picker you found. It filters all open windows by name; press ↵ to jump straight there.

- **Quick Open Recent**  
  Command: `File: Open Recent…` / `workbench.action.quickOpenRecent`.  
  Opens a similar searchable list, but it also includes recently closed workspaces. Handy if you want to reopen something you just quit. Bind it to something like ⌃⌘R if you want fast access:
  ```json
  {
    "key": "ctrl+cmd+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenRecent"
  }
  ```

- **Switch Window (Command Palette variant)**  
  Command: `Window: Switch Window` (`workbench.action.switchWindow`).  
  This lives in the Command Palette by default—type “Switch Window” and you’ll see a numbered list of open VS Code windows you can jump to.

### Bonus: OS-level shortcuts
- **macOS**: `⌘`` cycles through VS Code windows; `⌘⇧\`` cycles in reverse.  
- **macOS Mission Control**: Assign a shortcut (System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Mission Control → “Application windows”) to get an Exposé-style grid of VS Code windows.

Pick the flavor that fits your muscle memory best, and feel free to wire up additional keybindings via `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` if you want everything on home-row keys.

I’m gathering and reconstructing the exact text of each message exchanged so I can create a clear, chronological transcript including all user and assistant entries with their full content.**Preparing patch to create full transcript file**

I’m putting together a patch file that adds the entire VS Code chat transcript as a markdown file in the root folder, carefully formatting each message with proper quoting and preserving all code blocks and special characters, so it’s ready to be created with apply_patch.
```

```
**Summarizing final response plan**Transcribed our entire chat into a root-level markdown file as requested; Plan: confirm the new artifact, note its contents, and surface any follow-up considerations.

## actions taken
- Added `chat-transcript-2025-09-30.md` at the project root containing all 23 user/assistant messages from this session in chronological order, including code blocks and bullet lists where applicable.

## notes
- No builds or tests were run (documentation-only change).
- Feel free to relocate or prune the transcript; it’s a straight Markdown log ready for archival or sharing.

Let me know if you’d like a different format or additional metadata (timestamps, speaker labels, etc.).

_**Assistant**_

**Organizing save-selection documentation**

I’m preparing to create a new folder and key files for the “save-selection” feature, pulling goal and requirement info from the existing PRD. I plan to build README, spec, and design docs that cover the feature’s purpose, UI options, technical scope, and architecture. The goal is to follow the stage gate process with clear planning docs.**Drafting README outline**

I’m putting together a README for Save-Selection that explains its goal—helping artists export consistent aspect ratio crops—plus the key requirements from must-haves, target audience like Dragline artists, and some open questions about UI defaults and ratio controls. This should make the project clear and approachable!**Drafting spec document structure****Drafting design document structure****Preparing final response**Folder scaffolded and populated—new planning kit lives under ``.

## actions taken
- Created `README.md` outlining goal, key requirements, target audience, and open questions distilled from the PRD.
- Authored `spec.md` detailing functional scope, technical expectations, and three UI treatment options with trade-offs.
- Added `design.md` capturing architectural considerations, interaction flow, visual sketch, and future extensions.

## notes
- Documentation-only updates; no builds or tests were executed.
- Source inputs taken from the existing `save-selection-prd.md`. Let me know if you’d like the new docs cross-linked elsewhere.
