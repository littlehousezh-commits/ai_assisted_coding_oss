Why is this cursor config file incorrect? ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about a Cursor config file that's supposedly incorrect. The file is at `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json`. 

I should read this file to see what's wrong with it. Let me read it first.</details></think>
I'll read the Cursor settings file to see what might be incorrect.
Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json
<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the Cursor settings.json file, I need to find what's incorrect. Let me scan through it:

1. Lines 2-126: The `augment.chat.userGuidelines` value is a multi-line string that starts on line 2 and appears to continue...
2. The string starts with a quote on line 2 but doesn't end until line 126

Looking at the structure:
- Line 2: `"augment.chat.userGuidelines": "PURPOSEFUL BRITTLENESS DURING LLM DEV`
- Lines 3-126 contain the content
- Line 126: ends with `"Mermaid v8.8.0 doesn't support <br/> tags or special characters (×, ><) in node labels - use plain text with spaces instead.",`

Wait, line 126 ends with a comma AFTER the closing quote. But then line 127 continues with a new setting. That seems correct actually.

Let me check if there's a JSON syntax issue. The string on lines 2-126 appears to be a multi-line string, but JSON doesn't actually support true multi-line strings. Each line should be:
- Either escaped with \n
- Or be part of a single line

Looking more carefully at line 2: `"augment.chat.userGuidelines": "PURPOSEFUL BRITTLENESS DURING LLM DEV`

This opens a string but never closes it until much later. In JSON, you cannot have actual newlines inside a string literal - they must be escaped as `\n` or the string must be on a single line.

That's the error! The `augment.chat.userGuidelines` value is trying to be a multi-line string, but JSON doesn't support actual newlines within string values. The string needs to either:
1. Be on a single line, or
2. Have each line end with `\n` and be concatenated properly

Currently, the JSON is invalid because there's an actual newline after line 2 without closing the quote first.</details></think>
I found the issue! The problem is in the `augment.chat.userGuidelines` setting (lines 2-126). 

**The Issue:** JSON doesn't support multi-line strings with actual newlines. Your string starts on line 2 with an opening quote but has raw newlines throughout, which makes it invalid JSON.

In JSON, you need to either:
1. Put the entire string on one line
2. Use `\n` escape sequences for newlines within the string

Here's the fix - the string needs to be formatted like this:

```json
{
    "augment.chat.userGuidelines": "PURPOSEFUL BRITTLENESS DURING LLM DEV\n- dont use defaults\n- don't do exception handling\n- don't mock apis\n- don't add fallbacks\n- etc\n- this is important\n\nVIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT CONVENTIONS\n- use .venv instead of venv for virtual environments\n\nSECURITY AND CONFIGURATION\n- always put keys etc in .env file and access via dotenv\n...",
```

Would you like me to fix this file for you by converting all the newlines to `\n` escape sequences?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to fix the Cursor settings file by converting all the newlines to proper `\n` escape sequences. I need to read the file, convert the multi-line string to a properly escaped JSON string, and write it back.

Let me do this carefully to preserve all the content while making it valid JSON.</details></think>
