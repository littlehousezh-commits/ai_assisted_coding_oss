Based on the search results, I can tell you about the fonts being used in your blog:

1. Main Body Font Stack:
```
et-book, Palatino, "Palatino Linotype", "Palatino LT STD", "Book Antiqua", Georgia, serif
```
This is a classic serif font stack used for the main body text, inspired by Tufte CSS.

2. Code Font Stack:
```
Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace
```
This is used for code blocks and inline code.

3. Atkinson Font:
There are two custom Atkinson font files loaded:
- Atkinson Regular (400 weight)
- Atkinson Bold (700 weight)

The font sizes vary by element:
- Base font size: 15px or 16px (depending on the file version)
- Headings: 
  - h1: 3.2rem
  - h2: 2.2rem
  - h3: 1.7rem
- Body text: 1.4rem
- Code: 1.125rem
- Sidebar content: 0.9rem

The fonts are also responsive, with slightly smaller sizes on mobile devices (screens below 768px).

Let me search through the codebase to find where the Atkinson font is being applied.

Interestingly, while the Atkinson font files are being loaded in the `BlogLayout.astro` file and preloaded in `Head.astro`, I don't see any CSS rules that actually apply the Atkinson font to any elements. The main body text is using the et-book font stack:

```css
font-family: et-book, Palatino, "Palatino Linotype", "Palatino LT STD", "Book Antiqua", Georgia, serif;
```

So while the Atkinson font files are being loaded, they don't appear to be actively used in the styling. This might be an oversight or the font might be intended for future use. Would you like me to help you apply the Atkinson font to specific elements in your design?

of the fonts being used, which would make a good favicon

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your font stack, here are the fonts being used and their suitability as a favicon:

1. `et-book`: This is your primary font, a classic serif font designed for readability. While elegant, serif fonts typically don't make great favicons as the fine details can get lost at small sizes.

2. `Palatino` and its variants (`"Palatino Linotype"`, `"Palatino LT STD"`, `"Book Antiqua"`): These are also serif fonts with similar characteristics to et-book. Like et-book, they're not ideal for favicons due to their detailed serifs.

3. `Georgia`: Another serif font, with similar limitations for favicon use.

4. `Consolas`, `"Liberation Mono"`, `Menlo`, `Courier`: These monospace fonts (used for code blocks) could work better as favicons since they're more geometric and maintain legibility at small sizes.

For a favicon, I would recommend:

1. Using a single letter (like the first letter of your blog/site name) in a bold monospace font like Consolas
2. Or better yet, create a simple geometric icon that represents your blog's theme
3. If you want to use text, consider using a sans-serif font (which you're not currently using in your site) specifically for the favicon, as they tend to be more legible at small sizes

Would you like me to help you create a favicon using any of these approaches?

got suggestions?

Or better yet, create a simple geometric icon that represents your blog's theme

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your site's design, which uses the Tufte CSS style and emphasizes elegant typography and sidenotes, I can suggest a few geometric icon concepts that would work well as a favicon:

1. A minimalist margin note icon:
   ```
   [ | ]
   ```
   Where the vertical line represents the main text and the bracket represents the sidenote/margin note - a key feature of your blog's design.

2. An open book abstraction:
   ```
   ◠◡
   ```
   Two curved lines representing open pages, which fits with the scholarly/literary nature of the Tufte style.

3. A geometric quill/pen tip:
   ```
   ◆
   ```
   A simple diamond shape suggesting a pen nib, representing writing and typography.

4. A minimal asterisk (like a sidenote marker):
   ```
   ✻
   ```
   This relates to the sidenote numbering system used in your design.

5. A simple ink drop:
   ```
   ●
   ```
   Given your workspace path includes "phenomenal.ink", this could be particularly fitting.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these ideas as a proper favicon? I can help create it in the appropriate format and size for web use.
