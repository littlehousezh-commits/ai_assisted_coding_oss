Here is a comprehensive `architectural_document.md` for the Funnel Flow application, synthesizing all the codebase and documentation insights, and including Mermaid diagrams for clarity.
# Funnel Flow: Architectural Overview

## 1. High-Level Application Overview

**Funnel Flow** is an AI-powered marketing funnel analysis and optimization platform. It enables users to submit a landing page link or offer description, select a target audience persona, and receive a detailed, actionable audit of their marketing funnel. The system identifies "funnel leaks," scores them, and provides A/B testable recommendations, along with sample social media copy tailored to the analysis.
## 2. Main Components

### 2.1 Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (v15), React 18, TypeScript
- **UI:** Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Key Components:**
  - `FunnelAnalysisForm`: Collects user input (link/text, persona)
  - `AnalysisResults`: Displays AI-generated analysis and recommendations
  - `ScoreDonut`: Visualizes scores for each funnel area
  - `Header`, `Footer`, `LoadingSpinner`

### 2.2 Backend (AI Service)

- **Framework:** Genkit (TypeScript)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via @genkit-ai/googleai)
- **Flows:**
  - `analyzeMarketingOffer`: Analyzes marketing offers for funnel leaks and suggestions
  - `generateSocialMediaCopy`: Generates social media copy based on analysis

### 2.3 Database

- **Current State:** No persistent database is implemented yet. All data is processed in-memory per request.
- **Planned:** Future roadmap includes user authentication (e.g., Firebase Auth) and a database (e.g., Firestore) for saving analysis history.

### 2.4 External Integrations

- **Google AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash):** For all generative AI tasks
- **Clipboard API:** For copying generated content in the frontend
## 3. Key Data Models

### 3.1 AnalyzeMarketingOfferInput

```typescript
{
  offerDetails: string, // URL or description
  inputType: 'link' | 'text',
  persona: string
}
```

### 3.2 AnalyzeMarketingOfferOutput

```typescript
{
  analysis: AnalysisItem[],
  sampleCopy: SampleCopy
}

type AnalysisItem = {
  id: string,
  area: string, // e.g., "Headline Clarity"
  score: number, // 1-10
  leak: string,
  fix: {
    primarySuggestion: string, // Suggestion A
    abTestSuggestion: string   // Suggestion B
  }
}

type SampleCopy = {
  platform: string, // e.g., "Instagram Post"
  content: string   // Generated copy
}
```

### 3.3 GenerateSocialMediaCopyInput

```typescript
{
  analysis: Array<{
    area: string,
    score: number,
    leak: string,
    fix: { primarySuggestion: string, abTestSuggestion: string }
  }>,
  persona: string,
  offerDetails: string
}
```

### 3.4 GenerateSocialMediaCopyOutput

```typescript
{
  platform: string,
  content: string
}
```
## 4. Core Workflows

### 4.1 User Funnel Analysis Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend (Next.js)
    participant Backend (Genkit)
    participant Google Gemini AI

    Google Gemini AI-->>Backend (Genkit): Structured JSON response
    Backend (Genkit)-->>Frontend (Next.js): analysis + sampleCopy
    Frontend (Next.js)-->>User: Display results (AnalysisResults)
```

### 4.2 Social Media Copy Generation Workflow

*Currently, this is a backend capability, with planned UI integration.*

## 8. Summary

Funnel Flow is a modern, stateless, AI-driven web application with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Collects user input, displays results, and manages UI/UX.
- **Backend**: Orchestrates AI flows, validates data, and interacts with Google Gemini for analysis and copy generation.
- **Data Models**: Strictly defined with Zod for reliability and type safety.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for future integration with authentication, persistent storage, and advanced analytics.
