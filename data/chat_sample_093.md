How do I make a commit and override the husky pre-commit requirements?

---

_**Assistant**_

**Providing husky pre-commit override instructions**Use an environment override for a one-off commit:

````bash
HUSKY=0 git commit -m "your message"
````

This disables the Husky hook just for that command.

That threw an error:

> HUSKY=0 git commit
sh: --help/_/pre-commit: invalid option
Usage:  sh [GNU long option] [option] ...
        sh [GNU long option] [option] script-file ...

---

_**Assistant**_

**Analyzing Husky commit error**Use the skip flag and give the commit message in one command:

````bash
HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=1 git commit -am "chore: message"
````

---

_**User**_

Can I open the editor for commit message, or does it have to be inline for skip flag to work?

---

_**Assistant**_

**Clarifying commit message editing**`HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=1 git commit` works fine and will still drop you into the editor for the commit message.

It seems like there is a problem with the husky pre-commit. I am getting the `pre-commit: invalid option` no matter what I do:

 git commit
sh: --help/_/pre-commit: invalid option
Usage:  sh [GNU long option] [option] ...
        sh [GNU long option] [option] script-file ...

**Suggesting fix for macOS dirname issue**

I’m focusing on how the `dirname -- "$0"` usage in Husky’s pre-commit script causes errors on macOS because its `dirname` doesn’t support the `--` option. This leads to the shell trying to source a misinterpreted path like `--help/_/husky.sh`, causing the invalid option error. Removing the `--` argument and changing the line to `. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"` should fix it on macOS while keeping the script clean and compatible. I’ll prepare a brief code snippet illustrating this change with proper file path comment and existing code marker.`dirname` on macOS rejects the `--` flag, so sourcing Husky’s helper resolves to `husky.sh`, which triggers that error. Drop the flag:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
# ...existing code...
````

That changed nothing. I tried commenting out everything inside of pre-commit - still same error. So it seems to be caused by something else.

**Diagnosing invalid pre-commit hook path**

I see the error “sh: --help/_/pre-commit: invalid option” points to a misconfigured Git hooks path—most likely `core.hooksPath` is set to `--help/_`. To fix this, I’ll check the user’s git config with `git config core.hooksPath`, and if it’s incorrect, reset it to `.husky`. I’ll also remind to make the pre-commit script executable and ensure its shebang line is correct. I'll provide concise bash commands for these steps to help clarify the fix.Your Git hooks path is pointing to ``, so Git calls `sh --help/_/pre-commit`. Reset it and ensure the script is executable:

````bash
git config core.hooksPath .husky
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
````

The solution was to. use `--no-verify`

---

_**Assistant**_

**Acknowledging --no-verify usage**`git commit --no-verify` skips all hooks, so remember to run `npm test` manually when you use it.
